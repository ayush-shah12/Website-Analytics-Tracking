# üåê Personal Website Visitor & Icon Analytics

This is a **lightweight**, privacy-conscious FastAPI backend service designed to **log public request metadata** when users visit and interact with your personal website. It uses **publicly available information** such as *public* IP and browser headers ‚Äî no instrumentation, tracking scripts, or invasive analytics.
This was made for me to analyze the sources of traffic (or lack thereof) to my website.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stored, tracked, or cross-referenced. This is purely for personal insight and debugging purposes.

## üîß Features

- Logs request metadata in Logfire as well as sending real-time email alerts. 
- Extracts general geolocation info from the *public* IP (e.g., city, country)
- Supports custom source tracking via query params (e.g., `?a=resume` ‚Äî use a lookup table as I did to obfuscate this if you want too)
- Tracks icon clicks on your website to provide insight on user interactions beyond simple page visits. See if someone visited your LinkedIn, GitHub, etc... from your site!
- Built with **FastAPI** and designed to work with **any website**! Just add a simple script to call this backend service route on the a user visit to your site. 
- Zero tracking scripts, no cookies or information beyond what the browser already sends and is publically available.
